                <li>¼ cup fresh mozzarella, cut into small cubes</li>

            <h1>Directions</h1>
            <h2>Step 1</h2>
            <p>
                Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C).
            </p>
            <h2>Step 2</h2>
            <p>
                Place chicken breasts between two sheets of heavy plastic (resealable freezer bags work well) on a solid,
                level surface. Firmly pound chicken with the smooth side of a meat mallet to a thickness of 1/2-inch.
            </p>
            <h2>Step 3</h2>
            <p>
                Season chicken thoroughly with salt and pepper. Using a sifter or strainer; 
                sprinkle flour over chicken breasts, evenly coating both sides
            </p>
            <h2>Step 4</h2>
            <p>
                Beat eggs in a shallow bowl and set aside.
            </p>
            <h2>Step 5</h2>
            <p>
                Mix bread crumbs and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese in a separate bowl, set aside.
            </p>
            <h2>Step 6</h2>
            <p>
                Dip a flour-coated chicken breast in beaten eggs. Transfer breast to the bread crumb mixture,
                pressing crumbs into both sides. Repeat for each breast. Let chicken rest for 10 to 15 minutes.
            </p>
            <h2>Step 7</h2>
            <p>
                Heat 1/2 inch olive oil in a large skillet on medium-high heat until it begins to shimmer.
                Cook chicken in the hot oil until golden, about 2 minutes per side. The chicken will finish cooking in the oven.
            </p>
            <h2>Step 8</h2>
            <p>
                Transfer chicken to a baking dish. Top each breast with 2 tablespoons tomato sauce.
                Layer each chicken breast with equal amounts of mozzarella cheese, fresh basil, and provolone cheese.
                Sprinkle remaining Parmesan over top and drizzle each with 1/2 teaspoon olive oil.
            </p>
            <h2>Step 9</h2>
            <p>
                Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is browned and bubbly and chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes.
                An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
