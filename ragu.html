            <h1>Directions</h1>
            <h2>Step 1</h2>
            <p>
                Heat oil in a large Dutch oven over medium-high. Season chuck roast with pepper and 2 teaspoons salt.
                Sear meat until browned on every side, working in batches if necessary, about 10 minutes. 
                Remove from Dutch oven and transfer to a large plate.
            </p>
            <h2>Step 2</h2>
            <p>
                Reduce heat to medium and stir in onion. Cook, stirring often, until softened, about 8 minutes.
                 Add garlic and cook, stirring constantly, until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in harissa and tomato paste;
                  cook, stirring constantly, until caramelized, about 2 minutes.
            </p>
            <h2>Step 3</h2>
            <p>
                Pour in wine and cook, scraping the bottom of the pot with a wooden spoon to loosen any browned bits,
                until reduced by two thirds, about 5 minutes. Stir in tomatoes, bay leaf, chuck roast, and remaining 1 teaspoon salt.
                Reduce heat to medium-low and cover. Cook, stirring occasionally, until meat is tender, sauce has thickened,
                and flavors meld, about 2 1/2 hours.
            </p>
            <h2>Step 4</h2>
            <p>
                Remove and discard bay leaf. Transfer meat from Dutch oven to a cutting board and shred using 2 forks.
                Return meat to pot and stir in pappardelle. Top with grated Parmesan cheese.
